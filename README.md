### *Hospital Management system*  

**OVERVIEW:**
### Hospital Management System (HMS) Overview:

- **Purpose**: Automates hospital operations (patient management, appointments, billing, inventory).
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for different functions (e.g., patient records, staff management).
- **Database**: Stores and manages hospital data securely (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).
  
### Key Features:
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Optimized using algorithms (e.g., greedy, priority).
- **Billing and Payments**: Algorithms for cost calculation, discounts, and payment processing.
- **Medical Records**: Efficient data retrieval with search algorithms (e.g., binary search, hashing).
  
### System Design:
- **Efficiency**: Optimized database queries, caching, and load balancing.
- **Security**: Data encryption, authentication, and access control.
- **Scalability**: Cloud-based or distributed systems to handle growth.
- **Usability**: User-friendly interfaces for hospital staff and patients.

### Challenges:
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring correct patient and medical information.
- **Interoperability**: Integration with other healthcare systems.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Handling critical patient data in real-time.

### Benefits:
- **Improves hospital operations**.
- **Enhances patient care**.
- **Reduces operational costs**.

**Technical Stack:** 
Languages: C++, Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

**Impact:** 
### **Impacts of a Hospital Management System (HMS)**

1. **Improved Efficiency**: Automates tasks, speeds up data retrieval, and reduces manual work.
2. **Enhanced Patient Care**: Quick access to accurate patient information and better scheduling.
3. **Cost Reduction**: Optimizes resources, reduces administrative overheads, and minimizes wastage.
4. **Data Security**: Ensures compliance with regulations and protects patient data.
5. **Better Decision-Making**: Supports data-driven decisions and improves hospital planning.
6. **Scalability**: Grows with the hospital, adaptable to new locations and services.
7. **Enhanced Communication**: Improves coordination among staff and with patients.
8. **Operational Transparency**: Provides performance metrics for better accountability.
9. **Error Reduction**: Minimizes human error in patient records, prescriptions, and billing.
